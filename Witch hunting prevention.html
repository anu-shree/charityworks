                    The rural area of Jharkhand suffers from several types of vulnerabilities. Branding of women as &lsquo;witch&rsquo; is
                    one of the biggest vulnerabilities. Witch hunting is a splotch on the face of Jharkhand. The evil practice is mostly
                    found in the districts of West Singhbhum, Latehar, Ranchi, Khunti, Gumla, Lohardaga, Saraikela-Kharsawan, Bokaro, East
                    Singhbhum and Simdega.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 20px; line-height: normal; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">
                    Though the Malpractice is prevalent in several other states (12 as per NCRB), the undivided Bihar was the first state
                    to form an Act against it in 1999. Jharkhand adopted the same in 2001. The law is called &lsquo;Prevention of Witch
                    (Daain) Practices Act, 2001&rsquo;.</p>
                  <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 20px; line-height: 107%; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">As
                    per National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) of India total recorded murders in the name of witch Hunting in India is 2022
                    out of which In Jharkhand alone the figure is 523. However, these are only reported figures, there cannot be any
                    denial of the cases which might have gone unreported. As per civil societies there has been over 1800 murders in
                    Jharkhand in past 18 years of its existence! That means &lsquo;every third day a woman is lynched or murdered in the
                    name of Witch Hunting&rsquo;!</p>
                  <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 20px; line-height: 107%; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">On
                    an average every villages in Jharkhand would have 03 women who would be branded as witch and who are leaving there
                    life in threat and isolation. Branding is the first stage of hunting. After having branded these women and their
                    family members along with their children would live a life of threat and humiliation. Even death of a goat or a
                    chicken can convince the villagers that these women have been practicing witch craft and are behind the death of that
                    goat or that chicken. This slightest of hint has the capability to trigger the mob to rape them, torcher them, and
                    finally lynch them in public. In Jharkhand where there are more than 32000 villages, we can say that there would be
                    more than 1 Lakh women who have been branded as witch and are living their life in humiliation, isolation and under
                    threat of life.</p>
                  <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 20px; line-height: 107%; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">One
                    just need to be a woman to be branded as witch. Therefore while currently there would be just 1 lakh women who are
                    branded as witch but in fact every woman is potential victim of this malpractice. It just takes some Ojha or some
                    family member or some agitated neighbour to brand anyone as witch. Once the woman is branded it doesn&rsquo;t take
                    much time to make others believe this too. Therefore it is not just about the 1 lakh women but about every single
                    woman of the state and their rights.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 20px; line-height: normal; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">
                    &nbsp;In this context, it is important to address the issue with the help of Community Based Organisation (CBOs) in a
                    way that no public lynching can take place for these women who have been branded as &lsquo;Witch&rsquo; and secondly,
                    these women can lead a dignified life henceforth having access to all the basic rights and entitlements that they are
                    eligible for. Additionally, a sincere effort needs to put in to eliminate the whole possibility of even anyone being
                    hinted as &lsquo;Witch&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>

                    Hence the proposal on the project of making the state free from witch hunting and branding practices called
                    &lsquo;Garima&rsquo; is being put up to MoRD to be funded from Innovation fund under DAY-NRLM.</p>
                  <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 20px; line-height: normal; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">
                    <strong>Rationale:&nbsp;</strong>JSLPS is working for Witch Hunting Prevention since May 2017. We formed theatre
                    groups by training the interested SHG members on theatres and legal aspects of Witch Hunting, These theatre groups
                    were then sent to the identified villages for 2 days 2 nights for performing street play in every corner and important
                    places of the village as decided by the concerned VO of the village. &nbsp;So far about 500 villages have been covered
                    from 35 CLFs of 18 Blocks of 6 districts. Till now 932 survivors of the Witch Hunting have been identified through the
                    campaign. Public hearings were conducted at the block levels for ensuring entitlements and due rights to the
                    survivors. In 2018 and 2019 we had conducted impact analysis of the campaign in the life of each of these survivors
                    with the help of interns from the universities. Through the impact analysis was done for more than 500 survivors,
                    there were mixed responses. After discussing with the survivors, their family members, fellow SHG members, villagers,
                    PRI members and other stake holders like Police, Women and Child Development dept,&nbsp;&nbsp;District Legal Service
                    Authority, education dept, Health Dept, DLSA etc. overall it was concluded that&nbsp;</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li style="margin-left: 20px;">a strong follow up is required for the survivors</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Each survivor needs to be nurtured and groomed through a well-structured plan for their
                      counselling and livelihood through multiple round of trainings and Capacity Building.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 20px;">The campaign should be an annual activities to re-establish the importance of the
                      issue.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 20px;">All the stakeholders needs to be taken on board for creating large support base for the
                      survivors.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 20px;">More number of villages needs to be covered under the campaign.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 20px;">A helpline to be established so that the survivors won&rsquo;t have to wait for the
                      campaign to begin. The helpline should be able to provide immediate necessary support and protection to the
                      survivors.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 20px;">A large base of survivors shall emerge who could head on with the issue of Witch
                      Hunting with activated sensitivity.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 20px;">A protection teams to be formed at the village level for regular social counselling of
                      the community. The protection team shall keep a watch on the branding practices. They would immediately come forward
                      for the help of any survivor in case of any threat like situation.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Counselling of the survivors and its family.&nbsp;</li>
                  </ul>

                    However, all these activities would require dedicated budget and project functionaries. Hence the proposal is created
                    under innovation fund.&nbsp;</p>
